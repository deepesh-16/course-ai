# Course AI

## Abstract
According to the latest Pearson study, in 2019, 62 percent of Indians liked the concept of combining the convenience of passive learning online, with the quality of active learning in-person and experienced taking classes online. And nowadays there are many courses available for students, and sometimes it is hard for a student to perceive information related to those courses and decide which course to take. This is where our application CourseAI can be very pivotal and helpful to students to shortlist the top and relevant courses and choose the right one amongst them.

## Existing system
There are currently systems that display a wide range of courses for a particular domain, but there is no system that finds courses with the highest ratings from multiple websites. Older systems allow students to choose their course solely based on their interests, without considering prerequisite knowledge.The courses are presented from all institutions rather than only the ones which are offered by credible institutions.

## Objectives
1. The main objective of our project is to help the user in selecting a course that is relevant to him/her.
2. He/she should choose a course that suits his/her interests and matches the prerequisite knowledge so as to be able to adjust easily to the course curriculum.
